# spotify_project

As regular listeners of music, podcasts and relaxing sounds (white noise promoting concentration), we were naturally attracted to the Spotify topic. This project allowed us to discover the type of data that the company Spotify can generate, both on artists and on titles present on its platform. Our approach, initially educational, has evolved to offer us a deeper understanding of musical trends, listener preferences and mechanisms behind the success of a title or an artist.
By exploring artist data, 2020 global top 200 tracks and available songs on Spotify, we were able to analyze and interpret the massive information generated by this platform, opening the door to a deeper understanding of the music industry and data analysis.
The objective of this topic is to exploit data extracted from the Spotify streaming platform. We analyzes the data of the artists, the titles which are part of the world top200 of the year 2020, and the songs present on Spotify.
